# BlackFriday-Dataset-Analysis

This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of sales transactions from a retail store, featuring 550,069 rows and 12 columns. The objective is to perform a regression analysis to predict future sales, using advanced data science techniques. The project is designed to enhance feature engineering skills and improve understanding of everyday retail shopping patterns.

Key steps in the analysis include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Addressing missing values and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's complexity while retaining essential information.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementing K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive visualization component, created using Excel, which presents key relationships and insights through an interactive dashboard. The dashboard helps in understanding sales trends and patterns effectively.

Throughout the analysis, various machine learning models were tested, including Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. However, the best performance was achieved using the Random Forest Regressor, which provided superior predictive accuracy and generalizability.

This repository contains all the code and resources used in the analysis, including data preprocessing scripts, feature engineering techniques, PCA implementation, model training, and visualization outputs. The goal of this project is to provide a thorough and practical approach to retail sales prediction and to serve as a resource for those looking to enhance their data science skills in the context of real-world datasets.
